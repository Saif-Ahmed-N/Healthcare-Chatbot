# This file connects Rasa to your custom actions and other services.

# --- CRITICAL FIX ---
# This tells Rasa to send all action execution requests
# (e.g., 'action_create_new_patient') to our *single* FastAPI
# backend at the '/rasa/webhook' endpoint we created.
# This ELIMINATES the old 'rasa run actions' server.
action_endpoint:
  url: "http://localhost:5055/webhook"
